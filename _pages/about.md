I'm now an Associate Professor at <a href="https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en">Leiden University</a>, the Netherlands. I am interested in information retrieval and natural language processing, with an emphasis on conversational artiﬁcial intelligence, recommender systems, and social media analysis. I aim to develop intelligent agents that can address complex user requests and solve core challenges in NLP and IR towards that goal. I got my PhD from University of Amsterdam in 2016, supervised by Prof. Dr. Maarten de Rijke. Prior to that, I received my B.E and M.E from Shandong University in 2009 and 2012 respectively, and worked as a short-term visiting scholar in Max-Planck-Institut für Informatik, 2012.
