### **Professor**

I am currently a full professor at Shandong University, China. I’m leading a growing and productive information retrieval and natural language processing group. Prior to this, I worked as a senior research manager at JD.com and a research associate in University College London. I got my PhD from University of Amsterdam, supervised by Prof. Dr. Maarten de Rijke. I am interested in information retrieval, social media mining, and natural language processing. Before joining UvA, I received my B.E and M.E from Shandong University in 2009 and 2012 respectively, and worked as a short-term visiting scholar in Max-Planck-Institut für Informatik, 2012.
